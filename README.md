## About NutriGPT
NutriGPT is like a smart app powered by AI that links up to a real-time **SQLite database** and cooks up data embeddings. It's into using Pathwayâ€™s [LLM App features](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app) to whip up a real-time Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled data pipeline in Python. It's like mixing and matching data from different databases.

## Using the LLM App
- NutriGPT works its magic with the LLM (Large Language Model) App features from Pathway to make a real-time data pipeline.
- This App is a language whiz, letting users ask questions in plain language and get the scoop on nutrition insights.
- NutriGPT uses the LLM's powers to crunch text data and extract meaning from various sources, including its link to an SQL database.
- Specifically, it uses NFHS5 (National Family Health Survey 5) data, so you're getting the freshest and most reliable info on nutrition in India.
- This direct database link makes NutriGPT super effectiveâ€”it can grab and analyze data from different apps and databases, giving you a full picture of nutrition trends. This makes things way more efficient and effective.

## Code sample
There's some code that gets things connected to the database and pumps out a JSONL file when there are updates. It's all about keeping things real-time and up to date.

Then there's a snip of code that processes the JSONL file using the Pathway API. It's all about embedding data and getting responses based on queries.

## How to run the project
You can clone the repository, set some environment variables, install dependencies, and run the app. If you're a Windows user, think about using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Dockerize the app to get it running.

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure you've got [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10 or higher.
2. Grab [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to handle project packages.
3. Get an [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) account and snag an API Key for using their services.

You can find detailed steps in the repository's README on how to set things up and run the app.

### Testing the app
When you upload the file and ask questions on the UI, you'll get responses based on the data. For example:

```
Tell me about high Blood pressure situation in India?
```

And you'll get a cool response with data and insights about high blood sugar in India.

So, yeah, that's the lowdown on NutriGPT. It's a cool app that dishes out nutrition insights for India, keeping you in the loop about all things health-related!"
